1. Who talks to CyberArk CCP?

In our setup, AWX is not a standalone server; it runs in Kubernetes.

Jobs run inside Execution Environment (EE) pods.

When a job fetches a secret, the EE pod makes an HTTPS call like:

https://ccp.company.com/AIMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=...&Safe=...&Object=...

2. What CCP team cares about

CyberArk doesn’t care about:

The AWX web UI endpoint (like awx.devsecops…com).

The target servers/DBs you run tasks against.

They care about:

The source IP that reaches their CCP endpoint.
(Because CCP checks: “Is this request coming from an allowed machine for this AppID?”)

3. So, what IP do they expect from us?

That depends on how our Kubernetes cluster egresses traffic:

If cluster is in private subnets with a NAT gateway → the NAT Gateway Elastic IP(s) are the source.

If traffic goes via corporate proxy → the proxy IP(s) are the source.

If CCP is on a private link/peering → the node/ENI private IPs (or a specific egress gateway) are the source.

The client basically wants to know: “Which IP address(es) will CCP actually see when your AWX job pod calls me?”

4. Why its importetent:

CyberArk needs to whitelist those IPs against your AppID (e.g., awx-dev).
If they don’t, CCP will return 401/403 Unauthorized, even though your Safe/Object is correct.
