Before I move ahead, Iâ€™d like to get your approval for the final solution to monitor AWX using Prometheus and Grafana.

From our testing, we found that Prometheus cannot directly collect metrics from AWX because of authentication and header issues.
To fix this, I suggest using an AWX Exporter, which is a small, open-source service made for this purpose.

ðŸ”¹ It connects to the AWX API securely using stored credentials.
ðŸ”¹ It provides metrics in a format that Prometheus can easily read.
ðŸ”¹ This method is simple, reliable, and works well for production use.

Once you approve, Iâ€™ll deploy it in the monitoring namespace and connect it with our Grafana dashboard.

Please confirm if I can go ahead with this plan.
