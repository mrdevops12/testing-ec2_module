1. RAW_JSON='...'
You're defining a multi-line JSON object with key-value pairs (like product name, owner, tags, etc.).

2. ENCODED_JSON=$(echo "$RAW_JSON" | base64 -w0)
You're encoding the JSON into a base64 string (so it becomes a safe single-line value for GitHub to handle in outputs/env).

3. echo "... >> $GITHUB_ENV"
This makes the encoded string available as an environment variable for later steps in the same job (in case you want to echo $DEPLOY_META_JSON within deploy).

4. echo "... >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT"
This is the key part â€” it declares DEPLOY_META_JSON as a named output of the job (from the set-meta step).

After that 
notify:
  needs: deploy
  uses: ./.github/workflows/gmailNotification.yaml
  with:
    DEPLOY_META_JSON: ${{ needs.deploy.outputs.DEPLOY_META_JSON }}

Passing the exact same base64-encoded version of the original RAW_JSON into the gmailNotification.yaml workflow.
And then inside that workflow, you do:
  echo "$DEPLOY_META_JSON" | base64 -d | jq ...
     Decode the base64 string back into the original JSON and loop through it.



    RAW_JSON:  	 Your actual metadata in JSON
    
   ENCODED_JSON:  	Base64-encoded version of RAW_JSON
   
   GITHUB_OUTPUT:  	Makes ENCODED_JSON available to next job
   
   needs.deploy.outputs.DEPLOY_META_JSON:	Passes that encoded string to the next job
   
  base64 -d : in Gmail job	Recovers the original metadata safely for email
